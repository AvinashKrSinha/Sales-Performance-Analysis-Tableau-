## 🌐 Project overview

**Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive Tableau project designed to help stakeholders monitor and analyze sales across regions, products, and time. The project includes:

* Executive-level KPI summaries (Sales, Profit, Quantity)
* Year-over-year (YoY) and weekly performance analysis
* Product subcategory comparisons
* Filterable dashboards with custom icons for navigation
* Visualizations for both EU and non-EU regions

This repo covers the full workflow: data import → cleaning → modeling → dashboard design → storytelling (demo video + documentation).

---

## ✨ Key features

* **KPI Summary:** Aggregate Sales, Profit, and Quantity at a glance (CY vs PY).
* **Regional Breakdown:** Separate insights for EU and non-EU markets.
* **Trend Visualizations:** Monthly, yearly, and weekly trends with highlights for peaks/troughs.
* **Product Insights:** Subcategory-level sales & profit comparisons to reveal growth areas and underperformers.
* **Interactivity & UX:** User-friendly filters, clickable visuals, and custom icons for navigation.
* **Storytelling:** A guided walkthrough video and clear documentation to explain findings.

4. **Visualization design:** Built charts (KPIs, trend lines, histograms, ranked tables).
5. **Dashboard assembly:** Assembled visuals, icons, and filters for an intuitive UX.
6. **Documentation & demo:** Included this README and a video walkthrough (`Tableau_Dashboard_Demo.mp4`).
